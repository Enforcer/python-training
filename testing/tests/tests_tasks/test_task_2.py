"""Write a unit tests for tuple, testing its immutability.

Do proper import, bootstrap class with tests and implement the following scenario:
- create a tuple with 3 elements, e.g. ints
- try to substitute element at, for example, index 0
- assert that such an operation fails and an expected exception is raised
- you can add a check if tuple remains untouched
