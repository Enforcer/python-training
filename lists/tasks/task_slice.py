# In a given list, find index of 4 using .index function
# then using slicing, divide the list into two parts:
# 1. before position of 4
# 2. after position of 4
# (4 should not be included in any of those lists)
#
# Finally, create a list by combining these two parts

a_list = [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]
