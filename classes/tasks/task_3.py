# Define two classes - Point and Segment.
# Point should consist of two fields - x and y coordinates.
# Segment should consist of two points - a and b.
#
# Add __len__ dunder method to Segment that will calculate length of the Segment.
# The formula is math.sqrt((point_2.x - point_1.x)**2 + (point_2.y - point_1.y)**2)
