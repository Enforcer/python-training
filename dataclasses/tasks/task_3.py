# Create a dataclass Result with two fields:
# - success - boolean type, default True
# - errors - list of strings, use default factory to ensure it will be properly initialized
# Create three instances:
# - one with success True and no errors
# - second one with success False and a list of errors
# - third one with success False and empty list of errors
# Add some errors to the list in case of third instance.
