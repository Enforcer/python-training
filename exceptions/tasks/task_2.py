# Ask user for their name using input() function.
# If they try to end the program using CTRL+C (interrupt), do not let them do that!
# Catch KeyboardInterrupt exception and print a warning that you wan't stop unless they give you the name.
# If the input they enter is empty, also recognize this situation and retry - until they give you a non-empty string.
# TIP: use .strip() to remove whitespaces.
