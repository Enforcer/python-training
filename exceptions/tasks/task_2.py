# Open a file "some_file" manully in read-only mode ('r') by using function open(), example:
# ```
# file = open("filename", "r")
# ```
#
# Try writing to the file (file.write("string")) in try..except block.
# Catch the exception.
#
# Don't forget to close the file in finally or else block.
#
# try..except..finally block, try to read the file to make sure it's actually closed.
#   You should get another exception, but you don't have to catch it this time.
