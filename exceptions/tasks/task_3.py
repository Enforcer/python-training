# Open a file "some_file" manully in read-only mode ('r') by using open() as a function, not a context manager.
# Try writing to the file in try..except block, catching the appropriate exception.
# Don't forget to close the file in finally block.
# After everything, try to read the file to make sure it's actually closed. You should get another exception, but you don't have to catch it this time.
