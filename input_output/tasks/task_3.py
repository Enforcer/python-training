# Write an infinite loop that will be accepting user's input using input() function
# When user enters 'END', use break to stop the loop.
#
# In every other case, open the file "task_3_file" in APPEND mode and write additional text, then close the file.
# Once user enters 'END', open the file again and read its contents, then print it.
